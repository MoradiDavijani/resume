# My Resume

This repository contains the source code and content of my resume. It is created using LuaLaTeX compiler on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) and using [AltaCV](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV) document class as the starting point. I customized the class and renamed it to `resume` to simplify and meet my specific needs.

## Preview

To see the rendered version of my resume, visit the [PDF file](resume.pdf).

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MoradiDavijani/resume.git

2. Optionaly, you can upload the files to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) if you do not have the LuaLatex compiler set up on your local machine. It is free to use for personal projects and has a live preview feature which is very helpful.

3. Customize the resume by editing the source code files (`resume.tex`, and the files in `sections` folder) with your own information.

4. Build the resume using LuaLaTeX or on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) to generate the PDF output.

5. Optionally, you can modify the styling and layout by adjusting the resume class options and the associated style files (resume.cls).
